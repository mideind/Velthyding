# Velthyding.is — Icelandic Machine Translation Website

## Introduction

*Velthyding.is* is a web front end for [Miðeind](https://miðeind.is)'s neural machine
translation engine, implemented in Javascript and React.

The website allows translation of text and documents between Icelandic and English.
Both the web and the engine are under rapid development.

Try Velthyding at [https://velthyding.is](https://velthyding.is)!

## Development

### Configuration

See `config.js` for setting endpoint domains, default selections and customizing branding (logo, colors). Endpoints need to follow the [Google translate REST specification](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/rest) for compatibility with the interface.

### Setup and development

You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To install dependancies run

```bash
npm install
```

To start up the development server run

```bash
npm run-script start
```

To create a build run

```bash
npm run-script build
```

If you run into issues when building or running the development server, try increasing the available memory with 

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096
```

### Linting

The code should follow the [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react). Linting is configured in `.eslintrc.json` and the code can be fixed using prettier by running 

```bash
npx eslint 'src/**/*.{js,jsx}' --fix
```
